            When I think about the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, there are a lot of values that come to mind. Out of those values, one of the most important value is affection. Affection is very important to me because as cliche as it may sound I believe there is no bigger happiness than the feeling of being loved. Most of the instances in my life when I felt the happiest was when I felt loved by my family or friends. Of course I know that my family and friends love me at all times. However, it's the little things that remind me again how much I really am loved.

            The last topic someone asked for my advice was my best friend asking me advices on her relationship with her boyfriend because they were in a bit of a slump. I am no relationship-expert what-so-ever but she's been with her boyfriend for about 5 months and I've been with mine for over two and a half years so she would ask me advices time to time. When it comes to relatinoships, it has a lot to do with affection so I was happy to help my best friend in giving helpful advices because she is one of the people that I feel affectionate towards and care so much for.

            Last week I wrote a very short blog on how I've never experienced stereotype threat. However as I am writing this blog, I can think of an instance when I have experienced it. I am an introvert and in general I am a person with very few words. I've never been the talkative type and I am quite shy. When I first meet someone, it takes a while for me to really get comfortable and open up myself to them. I've heard many times from people that I have met for the first time that I am very quiet. To me, being labeled as quite is in itself a stereotype threat. Whenever I go to a new environment and meet new people, I try to be more talkative and more open so that I would not get labeled because once I get labeled as being quiet and shy, I find it harder for me to step out of the comfort zone and really express myself. Once I get labeled as quiet, I feel this pressure and unwanted attention on me when I try to speak out because it's something people don't expect from me. I am sure that once I go on-site in DBC, I might get labeled as quite again by other students. However, I've made some friends in DBC through peer sessions and GPS so I will continuously remind myself that I am not an outsider but a part of a team and that I am always loved.
