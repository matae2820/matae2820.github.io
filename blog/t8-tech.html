            Today I will talk about the difference between dynamic and static typed languages in programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start off, static typed programming language is when a variable has to have explicit declaration or initialization before the variable can be used in the program. This initialization bounds the variable to a specific data type. Some examples of static typed programming language is Java and C++. In static typing, if a variable is not initialized but used in a program, there will be an error because the variable has not been declared.
            Here is an example in C++:
            <xmp>
              static int side;
              side = 5;
            </xmp>
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, dynamic typed programming language is when a variable does not have to have explicit declaration nor initialization. An example of dynamic typed programming language is Python.
            Here is an example in Python:
            <xmp>
              side = 5
            </xmp>
          </p>
          <p>
            It may seem like dynamic typed programming language is better because it is shorter. However, one down-side to dynamic typing is that it does not catch typos very well. For example, if you were using a variable called 'length' and in one of the equations misspelled it as 'lngth', static typed programming language will catch this error because 'lngth' was not declared. However, in dynamic typed programming language, 'lngth' will be thought as a new variable and there will be no error message. There is no right or wrong on which type is better. Personally, I prefer the static typing because I think few extra lines can help in debugging later on.
