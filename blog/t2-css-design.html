      CSS positioning properties are useful in positioning an element on a page.The elements can be moved from top, bottom, left, right; however, the outcome is different for whichever positioning property you use.
      Today I will teach you about the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed positionings.

    <p>
      Relative positioning means that the element is positioned relative to its normal position- normal meaning an element with no positions.

    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute positioning allows the element to move anywhere using the top, bottom, left, right properties.

    </p>
    <p>
      Fixed positioning means that the element is positioned relative to the browser.This means that even when you scroll down the page, the element will stay in the same position on your screen looking almost as if it's floating in the same place.
