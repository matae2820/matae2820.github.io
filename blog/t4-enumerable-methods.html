            Ruby's Enumerable Module is another way of looping in your code.Enumerables are preferred over looping because it is easier to see what is going on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I will talk about the #group_by method. The #group_by method does just what it sounds like. It groups the data based on the block you input. The output is going to be a hash of strings, arrays or even numbers. Let's take a look at an example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's say you have an array of numbers.
          </p>
            <xmp>
              numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
            </xmp>
          <p>
            Now we are going to group these numbers using modulo (%). If you are unfamiliar with what a modulo is, you can think of it is the remainder. For example, when you do 6/3, there is no remainder. Therefore, 6%3 would be 0. However, 6/5 has a remainder of 1 so 6%5 would be 1. Now we are going to group the numbers array by using %. We are going to separate the numbers by the values of the modulo.
          </p>
            <xmp>
              (1..6).group_by {|i| i%3}
            </xmp>
          <p>
            So the numbers 1 through 6 are iterating through the loop and each number is getting modulo-ed by 3.
          </p>
            <xmp>
              {0=>[3,6], 1=>[1,4], 2=>[2,5]}
            </xmp>
          <p>
            As you can see, the #group_by method creates a hash that groups the number array based on the value of their modulo.
          </p>
