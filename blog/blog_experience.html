        <h1>Experience of creating my own Website!</h1>

            Through Dev Bootcamp, I've had the chance to create my own website. I've had personal blogs before but I've never created something that I made from scratch. Designing and decorating have always been fun for me so I have to be honest and say that I concentrated on the visual aspects of the website as opposed to the contents of my blogs.

            Creating a website from scratch is such a rewarding experience. The fact that there is a URL dedicated just for me feels good. Even though my website is still pretty empty, I plan on continuously adding blog posts or pictures on my website. One down-side to creating a website is that the possibilites are endless and it's almost impossible to be completely satisfied with the visual aspects. It's important to dedicate time in the website and update it often. However, it is also important to manage time wisely and not stress so much.
