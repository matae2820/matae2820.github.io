        <h1>Arrays vs. Hashes in Ruby</h1>

      <p>
        Arrays and Hashes are important methods when learning Ruby. Simply put, arrays and hashes are both like a list in your computer. You can put in as much subjects as you want in the list and they are called variables. Variables can be anything from a string, float, or an integer. Now I will talk about the difference between arrays and hashes and the advantages of each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays can have thousands of variables in them or even none. However, all the variables are lined up in row so that the variables can be referenced with a number starting from 0. This means that if there are three variables in an array called colors,
        <xmp>
        colors = ['red','orange','yellow']
        </xmp>
        colors[0] would be referencing to 'red',
        colors[1] to 'orange',
        and colors[2] to 'yellow'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difference between arrays and hashes is that in hashes, the variables aren't lined up in a row, rather in a jumble. The variables in hashes can be referenced using anything and not just numbers. This may sound confusing and you may be thinking, why would I want my variables in a jumble. Arrays are used when the variables are related to each other. The colors array I created above store different colors. Hashes are used when there is no specific relation between the variables but you want to keep them together.
        <xmp>
        random_hash['cool_aid']= 'Tom'
        random_hash[22]= 'Rabbit'
        </xmp>
        The above example shows that 'Tom' can be referenced by random_hash['cool_aid'] while 'Rabbit' can be referenced using random_hash[22].
