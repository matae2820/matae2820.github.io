        One of the many benefits of version control is that it prevents common mistakes that occur when working as a team. I've had instances when I had to write a huge report in team and we thought making a google doc to work on the paper simultaneously would be a good idea. However, it was so easy for someone to accidently delete someone else's work or change it around. Version control prevents these mistakes by allowing the members of the group to work together separately. Later they are able to merge all the versions in one common version. Version control also makes it easy to track changes that was made during the progress.

        Git keeps track of the changes through commit. Commit is like the saving point. Therefore, if you commit, then it is easy to look back on the log and see where you were when you made a commit few days, months, or years ago.

        GitHub is very beneficial to store code. This is because GitHub is very easy to get your work onto the computer (pull) as well as save to your computer (fetch) different codes that you would want to keep. It just makes the process very easy.
