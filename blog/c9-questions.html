            This week for our blog post, we were asked to think about questions we have posted on Dev Bootcamp's google+ and examine whether the questions were good ones or not. Looking back I saw that I actually did not post any questions on google+. However, asking questions is something that is very important so I found researching for how to ask the perfect questions a helpful thing to do.

            Upon research, I learned that the title of the question is very important because the title must be interesting enough to grasp the attention of others. I think I've done a pretty good job in creating attention-grabbing titles for my questions. Last semester in UIUC, I took a course called Business Technical Writing 250. It was a course that taught how to write memos, emails, and all sorts of business related letters. Our professor taught us that the title is very important to grasp the attention of whomever the writing is for. I learned to create concise yet informative titles for questions.

            Another important aspect of a good question is that you must have tried to handle the problem before asking the question. In other words, you must try to solve the problem on your own first then ask questions. Sometimes when I am helping my younger sister with her homework, I get so frustrated at her because she asks questions without trying it out herself first. It not only makes me reluctant to help her, but it is also not very helpful for the person asking the questions. I think it is very important that when you ask a question, you show that you have tried to problem beforehand. Sharing the thought process of how the problem was approached is very helpful for the person giving answers.

            In two days, I will be starting phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp. I am as nervous as I am excited and the constant fear of me being the worst one out of my cohort members is really not helping. Sometimes it is easy to see questions as weakness because of fear that it makes one look less knowledgeable. However, asking questions are essential in learning and it is better to ask questions then pretend to know something. I hope to ask a lot of perfect questions in Dev Bootcamp!
