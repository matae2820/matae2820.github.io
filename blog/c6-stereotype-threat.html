            Fortunately, I am able to say that I do not think I've eve felt stereotype threat. If anything, I've only felt pressure to do better just because I am Asian and everyone says "Asians are smart" or "Asians are good at math".

            I remember when I first came to America as a third grader. Each week we would have to complete a sheet of mathmatics that had addition and subtraction questions in a timed setting. I'd always be the first one to finish the sheets because in Korea, we were taught addition and subtraction a year earlier so I was pretty good at it by then. However, because my English wasn't very good I struggled with short answer problems. Sometimes, my classmates would joke around saying "aren't you supposed to be good at math?". I guess it was because I knew they meant no harm by it that I never took it to be a threat. If anything, it motivated me to do better in my work.
