            I have a lot of conflicts in my life- usually small but once in a while big conflicts. One of the conflicts I had couple of months ago was with my younger sister. Anyone with a younger sibling will know that siblings will always have conflicts... a lot of them. Whenever I come back home from college during breaks, my younger sister, Grace likes to borrow my clothes and my jewelries. I've alwasy been nervous in lending her my things because she is such a clumsy person. One day she asked me if she could borrow my favorite necklace that my boyfriend got me as a gift. I was reluctant but I said yes. As she was walking out of my room holding the necklace on her right hand, the necklace got caught in the doorknob and broke. Just like that.

            I was so upset and furious because how often does something get caught in a doorknob. I was so angry and I yelled at her saying she has a cursed hand because everything she touches breaks apart. It also made me angry to think that she wasn't extra careful even when she knew it was my favorite necklace. It felt like she did not put much value towards my stuff that I was lending her. Also the fact that this was not the first time she had broken something that was precious to me did not make things better.

            Grace cried the night she broke my necklace because she felt so horrible and ashamed but at the time I was too furious to try to resolve the conflict. I just spent a week not talking to her and glaring at her at the dinner table. This was already a few months ago and now I can talk about it with Grace and joke about it. If I could go back I guess I would not be as harsh on her because I think she learned her lesson that day.

            I learned from this experience that no matter how big the situation may seem at the time, anything and everything can be resolved eventually.
