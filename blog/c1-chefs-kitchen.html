        After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video, my take on the DBC experience is that DBC is quite different from other bootcamps. Instead of just teaching the students how to code, DBC wants to teach about emotional intelligence and many other aspects that will help the students to think more intelligently.

      <p>
        My impression of DBC is that DBC tries to get people out of their comfort zone and try to make everyone truly open up and engage with everyone else. I have to be honest and say that I see myself struggling a bit in this type of culture because I am an introvert. Shereef mentioned in the video that he is also an introvert and that some of the activities done in class may be harder for introverts. I am quite scared about this; however, I signed up for DBC knowing I would have to get out of my comfort zone and really just try new things so I am just as excited as I am scared.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expectations of DBC changed in that I really believe DBC cares for the students. Their goal is not just to teach code but to go even further and help people realize new capabilities and possibilities about themselves. I am so nervous and excited for this new adventure.
