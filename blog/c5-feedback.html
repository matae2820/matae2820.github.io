            I've always been the type to prefer working alone in an assignment or work with a really small group of friends that I was super comfortable with. As an introvert, working in a group of people that I was unfamiliar with was always a struggle for me when it came to expressing my thoughts clearly. Peer pairing and GPS sessions in DBC was even more intimidating because I had never met any of the people there in person. I remember getting super nervous for my first gps session and peer pairing session and I stayed nervous for like the first three weeks. However, after each time I was relieved because fortunately everyone I have worked with so far had been very kind and understanding.

            I believe it is definitely true that two heads think better than one. In many of the challenges, I was able to pick up on and learn a lot of topics that I have missed. Also, I was able to teach and explain some of the topics that I had picked up on. I think that peer pairing sessions are a definite necessity during DBC phase0 because it also brings the people together. Even though none of us have met each other in person, just the fact that we were able to interact with different people in DBC before phase1 starts makes adjustment to the environment easier.

            Even though when we give feedbacks to our peers, we are supposed to be actionable, specific, and kind, I saw that a lot of the feedbacks I received and a lot of the feedbacks that I rated were mostly very short and not very actionable. However, I myself struggled with giving actionable and specific feedback. For most of the people I worked with, I couldn't think of anything actionable to write because I thought most of them were doing very great.

            When it came to reading my feedback, a lot of them were very kind and made me feel good. If there is one thing I want to work on improving for my next peer session, it is to get more assertive to ensure my points get across. This seemed to be the most common feedback I received. Overall, I think it is a very good exercise to give and receive feedback and know not to take anything for offense rather as useful information needed to improve.
