        After taking the <a href= "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style quiz</a>,  I realized that I have an equal makeup of pretty much all of the thinking styles. My results showed 28 for Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random and a 32 for Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random. This freaked me out a bit because I was worried this meant that I had no thinking style at all. However, for the purpose of finding out my thinking style to help myself learn better at DBC, I decided to concetrate on Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random styles. Upon doing <a href= "http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm"research </a> on these two styles, I found it very funny that these are pretty much the opposite thinking style to have.

      <p>
        The Abstract Sequential thinkers learn best when they are able to work alone. Which is true. I tend to enjoy working alone because I believe that it saves up a lot of time. I also enjoy it when my points are heard. I like to know that my peers are listening to what I am saying and taking it seriously. However, the Abstract Random thinker likes to listen to others which is also true. I also like to hear what others have to say and I learn a lot from others' points of view. The research also stated that Abstract Random thinkers learn best in group activities. Upon having done 2 GPS sessions and 4 pair sessions already, I realize that I do enjoy working with other people when everyone is focused and collaborating. So after the research, I realized that I like to visualize the problem and experiment with the problem. Many times while doing the exercises, I found myself trying different methods out and running it then making changes from there. At DBC, I will keep my challenges hands-on and try to tackle them by experimenting and trying different things.

        So far, the hardest part of DBC was the time management. I stressed the most on week 1 of phase 0 because I found out that we had challenges due Friday night. That was a mistake on my part for not reading the details carefully. However, starting the challenges that are meant to be done in a week was very stressfully for me when I tried to rush it in two days. I really rushed myself in the challenges so I missed a lot of the important details. When I moved onto the harder challenges, I found myself struggling and not knowing a lot of the information. I panicked and drew a conclusion that DBC was too hard for me. However, after taking an extension for the week 1, I was able to go through the material again and learn the materials I missed. Once I got that done, I started to really enjoy doing my work. As for the material, I am doing quite well in it. I will continue to keep track of my material and stay on top of it so that I don't miss materials. From now on, when I find myself struggling with the material, rather than thinking I am not good enough for DBC, I will try to have the growth mindset and see my obstacles as a way for growth.
