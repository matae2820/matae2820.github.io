            Today I will talk about the difference between an Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. Nowadays, the Object Oriented Programming is preferred over the other. Still, we see a lot of the Functional Programming because creating an Object Oriented Programming is not very easy- or at least that's what I think.

            An Object Oriented Programming means that the code is treated like.. well.. an object! This object can be changed and can perform specific tasks. For example, if we were to say that the object was a ball, we would be able to change the color of the ball and use it to perform different functions such as a basketball or football or soccer. This shows that the object can be reused with a little bit of modification. An Object Oriented Programming can be reused to create a different program using a similar skeleton. Just like a basketball and a football and a soccer ball are all balls in the general sense, they each have different functions and design that make each suitable for each sports.

            Functional Programming is when the purpose is to carry out the task rather than having it available to modify later. Overall, an Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming both may give the same results. However, the Object Oriented Programming is easier to break down into smaller objects and modify. In the case of the Functional Programming, modifying one tiny bit can cause a huge change because everything is interconnected. It is very much harder to make modifications in Functional Programming.
