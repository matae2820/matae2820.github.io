            To write this blog post, I did my research on problems facing the tech world and found an article that talked about the challenges facing the IT leaders. As an undergrad at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign majoring in Business- Information Systems and Information Technology(ISIT), I thought it would be a good topic to talk about.

            The biggest difficulty has to do with the speed in which the technology is becoming more and more advanced. In order to stay on top of the advancements, IT leaders must be able to quickly adapt to all kinds of new technology that is being introduced. To stay on top of things, businesses must know the behaviours of the people. With the creation of smart phones and high speed internet connections, a lot of the web surfing is being done on the devices. Businesses must study these changes and find a way to be more accessible.

            Thus, one of the biggest problem facing the tech world today is with the speed in which the technology is advancing. Businesses are struggling to keep up with the changes and there is a growing skills gap amongst employees with modern skills to be able to keep up with the changes.
